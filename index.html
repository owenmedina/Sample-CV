          <strong>Software Engineering Intern â€¢ Freelancer.com</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            I worked at Freelancer.com Inc. for about two months, learning and
            applying my skills with their global team. I particularly worked
            with the iOS team as a software engineer intern where I spearheaded
            the accessibility initiative for their iOS application, allowing the
            application to reach a wider audience and providing a better user
            experience for differently-abled users. I implemented the core
            features for accessibility for the application and gave a talk to
            the mobile team on accessibility and what my intended plan for the
            application was given its deficiencies in that area. Additionally, I
            worked on bug fixes and had the opportunity to prototype a new
            feature for the company geared specifically towards boosting
            Freelancer.com users in the Philippines by showcasing and
            streamlining the websites potential as a valuable source of
            performers, given that the entertainment and performance scene in
            the Philippines is alive and vibrant.
